We have now covered all the major functional areas defined in the API specification: Account Management, Video Catalog, Search, Comments & Ratings, Recommendations (stubs), and Moderation (including stubs for content restoration).

The next logical step isn't a new "Epic" of features from the API spec, but rather to focus on **Consolidation, Refinement, and Preparation for Individual Service Deployment.** This involves:

1.  **Centralizing Type Aliases:** Moving `UserID`, `VideoID`, `CommentID`, `FlagID` to `app/models/common.py`.
2.  **Service Entrypoints:** Creating the individual `main_<service_name>.py` files for each potential microservice.
3.  **Dockerfiles:** Creating example Dockerfiles for a couple of these services.
4.  **Review and Refine Tests:** Ensuring test coverage is reasonable and mocks are appropriate.
5.  **Finalizing `app/main.py`:** Making it clear whether it's for monolith deployment or just combined local development.
6.  **Updating README:** Adding instructions for running individual services and the monolith.

Let's call this "Phase 2: Polish and Packaging."

---

**Phase 2: Polish and Packaging**
*Goal: Refine the existing codebase, centralize common type definitions, create service-specific entrypoints and Dockerfiles, and ensure the project is well-organized for potential microservice deployment.*

  *   **Chunk P2.1: Centralize Common Type Aliases**
      *   **Step P2.1.1:** Modify `app/models/common.py`:
          *   Add `UserID = UUID`, `VideoID = UUID`, `CommentID = UUID`, `FlagID = UUID` (import `UUID` from `uuid`).
      *   **Step P2.1.2:** Modify all model files (`user.py`, `video.py`, `comment.py`, `flag.py`, `recommendation.py`) and service files that define or use these specific ID types:
          *   Remove local definitions of `VideoID`, `UserID`, etc.
          *   Import them from `app.models.common`.
      *   **Step P2.1.3:** Run `mypy .` to catch any type inconsistencies or import errors after these changes.
      *   **Step P2.1.4:** Tests:
          *   Rerun all existing tests. They should all pass if the refactoring is done correctly. No new tests are specifically for this change, but existing tests validate it.

  *   **Chunk P2.2: Create Individual Service Entrypoints**
      *   **Step P2.2.1:** Create `app/main_account.py`:
          *   Minimal FastAPI app instance.
          *   Includes only `account_management.router`.
          *   Sets up `init_astra_db` on startup, exception handlers, CORS (copy relevant parts from main `app/main.py`).
          *   Title it e.g., "KillrVideo - Account Management Service".
      *   **Step P2.2.2:** Create `app/main_video_catalog.py`:
          *   Minimal FastAPI app instance.
          *   Includes `video_catalog.router` (and potentially `flags.router` if video-specific flag endpoints were added there, or `reco_internal.router` if related video recos are considered part of catalog).
          *   For now, let's say it includes `video_catalog.router` (which has related videos) and `flags.router` (as flags are on content).
          *   Title it "KillrVideo - Video Catalog Service".
      *   **Step P2.2.3:** Create `app/main_comments_ratings.py`:
          *   Includes `comments_ratings.router`.
          *   Title it "KillrVideo - Comments & Ratings Service".
      *   **Step P2.2.4:** Create `app/main_search.py`:
          *   Includes `search_catalog.router`.
          *   Title it "KillrVideo - Search Service".
      *   **Step P2.2.5:** Create `app/main_recommendations.py`:
          *   Includes `recommendations_feed.router` and `reco_internal.router`.
          *   Title it "KillrVideo - Recommendations Service".
      *   **Step P2.2.6:** Create `app/main_moderation.py`:
          *   Includes `moderation.router` (which has flag management and user role management). (Note: `flags.router` for submitting flags is separate as it's user-facing).
          *   Title it "KillrVideo - Moderation Service".
      *   **Step P2.2.7:** Tests:
          *   No new functional tests. This is about deployment structure. Manual testing of running each service: `uvicorn app.main_account:service_app --port 8001`.

  *   **Chunk P2.3: Create Example Dockerfiles**
      *   **Step P2.3.1:** Create `services_dockerfiles/account_management.Dockerfile` (as detailed in Build Spec v1.1, Prompt 12, Step 2). It should:
          *   Use `python:3.10-slim`.
          *   Install Poetry, then project dependencies (`poetry install --no-dev --no-root`). If `--no-root` causes issues with editable installs for the local app, poetry install without it and ensure the `app` is copied correctly.
          *   Selectively COPY necessary files for the account service (e.g., `app/main_account.py`, relevant endpoints, models, services, core, db).
          *   CMD: `uvicorn app.main_account:service_app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`.
      *   **Step P2.3.2:** Create `services_dockerfiles/video_catalog.Dockerfile`:
          *   Similar structure, but copies files for the video catalog service and its dependencies (e.g. `app/main_video_catalog.py`, `video_catalog.py` endpoint, `flags.py` endpoint, `video_service.py`, `flag_service.py`, `recommendation_service.py` (for related), relevant models, core, db).
          *   CMD: `uvicorn app.main_video_catalog:service_app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`.
      *   **Step P2.3.3:** Tests:
          *   Build these Docker images locally: `docker build -t account-service -f services_dockerfiles/account_management.Dockerfile .`
          *   Run the container: `docker run -p 8001:8000 -e ASTRA_DB_... account-service` and test an endpoint.

  *   **Chunk P2.4: Review `app/main.py` and README**
      *   **Step P2.4.1:** Review `app/main.py`. Confirm it still includes ALL routers. Add a comment indicating this is primarily for combined local development/testing or for a monolith deployment.
      *   **Step P2.4.2:** Create/Update `README.md`:
          *   Brief project overview.
          *   Setup instructions (Poetry, environment variables in `.env`).
          *   How to run the full application (monolith): `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`.
          *   How to run linters/type checkers: `ruff check .`, `mypy .`.
          *   How to run tests: `pytest`.
          *   Instructions on how to run individual services (e.g., `uvicorn app.main_account:service_app --port <port_num>`).
          *   Instructions on how to build and run example Docker containers.

This phase focuses on packaging and deployment readiness rather than new features.

## LLM Prompts - Iteration 7 (Phase 2: Polish & Packaging)

---
**Prompt 27 (was P2.1): Centralize Common Type Aliases**
```text
Objective: Centralize common UUID-based type aliases (`UserID`, `VideoID`, `CommentID`, `FlagID`) into `app/models/common.py` and update all files that use them to import from this central location.

Specifications:
1.  Modify `app/models/common.py`:
    *   Import `UUID` from `uuid`.
    *   Add the following type aliases:
        ```python
        UserID = UUID
        VideoID = UUID
        CommentID = UUID
        FlagID = UUID
        # Add any other widely used ID type aliases if they emerge.
        ```
2.  Review and modify the following files (and any others that might be using local definitions of these ID types):
    *   `app/models/user.py`
    *   `app/models/video.py`
    *   `app/models/comment.py`
    *   `app/models/flag.py`
    *   `app/models/recommendation.py`
    *   All service files in `app/services/` (e.g., `user_service.py`, `video_service.py`, etc.)
    *   All endpoint files in `app/api/v1/endpoints/`
    *   For each file:
        *   Remove any local definitions like `VideoID = UUID`.
        *   Add `from app.models.common import UserID, VideoID, CommentID, FlagID` (as needed by the specific file).
3.  After making these changes, it's critical to ensure the application still type-checks correctly. Conceptually, run `mypy .` in your environment to verify. (You don't need to *show* the mypy output, just ensure the code would pass).
4.  No new tests are required for this refactoring. The existing test suite, when run, will help verify that the imports and type usages are correct across the application.

Current Files to Work On:
*   `app/models/common.py`
*   `app/models/user.py`
*   `app/models/video.py`
*   `app/models/comment.py`
*   `app/models/flag.py`
*   `app/models/recommendation.py`
*   `app/services/user_service.py`
*   `app/services/video_service.py`
*   `app/services/comment_service.py`

*   `app/api/v1/endpoints/flags.py`
*   `app/api/v1/endpoints/moderation.py`

Provide the complete content ONLY for `app/models/common.py`. For all other files, provide only the changed import statements and confirm that local ID type alias definitions were removed. Assume the LLM can correctly apply these changes across all listed files.
```
---
**Prompt 28 (was P2.2): Create Individual Service Entrypoints**
```text
Objective: Create separate FastAPI entrypoint files (`main_<service_name>.py`) for each logical service, preparing for individual containerized deployment.

Specifications:
For each service entrypoint file, include:
*   Necessary imports (`FastAPI`, service-specific router, `settings`, `init_astra_db`, common exception handlers, CORS middleware - you can copy these from the main `app/main.py`).
*   A new `FastAPI` app instance (e.g., `service_app = FastAPI(title="KillrVideo - <Service Name> Service", openapi_url=f"{settings.API_V1_STR}/<service_url_prefix_if_any>/openapi.json")`).
*   Startup event handler for `init_astra_db`.
*   Inclusion of only the relevant router(s) for that service, typically prefixed with `settings.API_V1_STR`.
*   A root health check specific to the service (e.g. `GET /`).

1.  Create `app/main_account.py`:
    *   Title: "KillrVideo - Account Management Service".
    *   Router: `account_management.router` (from `app.api.v1.endpoints.account_management`).
    *   OpenAPI URL: (e.g., `f"{settings.API_V1_STR}/accounts/openapi.json"`).
2.  Create `app/main_video_catalog.py`:
    *   Title: "KillrVideo - Video Catalog & Interactions Service".
    *   Routers: `video_catalog.router` (from `app.api.v1.endpoints.video_catalog`, includes related videos) and `flags.router` (from `app.api.v1.endpoints.flags`, for submitting flags against content).
    *   OpenAPI URL: (e.g., `f"{settings.API_V1_STR}/videocatalog/openapi.json"`).
3.  Create `app/main_comments_ratings.py`:
    *   Title: "KillrVideo - Comments & Ratings Service".
    *   Router: `comments_ratings.router`.
    *   OpenAPI URL: (e.g., `f"{settings.API_V1_STR}/commentsratings/openapi.json"`).
4.  Create `app/main_search.py`:
    *   Title: "KillrVideo - Search Service".
    *   Router: `search_catalog.router`.
    *   OpenAPI URL: (e.g., `f"{settings.API_V1_STR}/searchsvc/openapi.json"`).
5.  Create `app/main_recommendations.py`:
    *   Title: "KillrVideo - Recommendations Service".
    *   Routers: `recommendations_feed.router` and `reco_internal.router`.
    *   OpenAPI URL: (e.g., `f"{settings.API_V1_STR}/reco/openapi.json"`).
6.  Create `app/main_moderation.py`:
    *   Title: "KillrVideo - Moderation Service".
    *   Router: `moderation.router` (for moderator actions and role management).
    *   OpenAPI URL: (e.g., `f"{settings.API_V1_STR}/modsvc/openapi.json"`).

Shared components to include in each `main_<service>.py` (copied/adapted from `app/main.py`):
*   `FastAPI` app instantiation.
*   Import and setup of `settings` from `app.core.config`.
*   `init_astra_db` and the startup event handler.
*   `http_exception_handler` and `generic_exception_handler` (and `ProblemDetail` model import).
*   CORS middleware setup.
*   A simple root GET endpoint like `@service_app.get("/") async def service_root(): return {"service": "<Service Name>", "status": "healthy"}`.

Current Files to Work On:
*   `app/main_account.py`
*   `app/main_video_catalog.py`
*   `app/main_comments_ratings.py`
*   `app/main_search.py`
*   `app/main_recommendations.py`
*   `app/main_moderation.py`
*   (Implicitly `app/main.py` if copying exception handlers etc.)

Provide the complete content for each new `main_<service_name>.py` file. You can create a helper function or copy shared setup logic for brevity if the LLM can manage that, otherwise spell out one file completely and instruct it to replicate the pattern for others.
For router inclusion, ensure the correct router variable name is imported (e.g. `from app.api.v1.endpoints.account_management import router as account_management_router`).
The global `api_router_v1 = APIRouter(prefix=settings.API_V1_STR)` from `app/main.py` might not be needed in each service main if the service's router itself is directly included with `app.include_router(service_specific_router, prefix=settings.API_V1_STR)`. Let's try the latter: directly include the imported service router with the main API prefix.
```

**Prompt 29 (was P2.3): Create Example Dockerfiles**
```text
Objective: Create example Dockerfiles for two services (Account Management and Video Catalog) to demonstrate how they can be containerized.

Specifications:

    *   CMD: `["uvicorn", "app.main_account:service_app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]`.
2.  Create `services_dockerfiles/video_catalog.Dockerfile`:
    *   Base Image: `python:3.10-slim`.
    *   Set `WORKDIR /app`.
    *   Install Poetry (same as above).
    *   Copy `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` (same as above).

```
---
**Prompt 30 (was P2.4): Review app/main.py and Update README.md**
```text
Objective: Finalize the main `app/main.py` to clarify its role and create/update `README.md` with comprehensive project information and operational instructions.

Specifications:
1.  Modify `app/main.py`:
    *   Ensure it still includes ALL routers (`account_management`, `video_catalog`, `flags`, `comments_ratings`, `search_catalog`, `recommendations_feed`, `reco_internal`, `moderation`).
    *   Add a comment at the top of the file or in the FastAPI app description:
        ```python
        # This main.py assembles all service routers into a single FastAPI application.
        # It's suitable for monolith deployment or for local development and testing
        # of the combined application. For individual microservice deployment,
        # use the respective app.main_<service_name>:service_app entrypoints.
        ```
    *   Ensure the FastAPI app instance in `app/main.py` has a distinct title, e.g., `title="KillrVideo 2025 - Monolith Backend"`.
2.  Create/Update `README.md` at the project root with the following sections:
    *   **KillrVideo 2025 - Python Backend** (Main Title)
    *   **Overview:** Brief description of the project, its purpose (FastAPI reference application for KillrVideo), and key technologies (FastAPI, AstraDB, Poetry).
    *   **Prerequisites:**
        *   Python 3.10+
        *   Poetry (installation link or command)
        *   Astra DB instance and credentials.
    *   **Setup & Configuration:**
        *   Clone the repository.
        *   Install dependencies: `poetry install`.
        *   Environment Variables: Explain to copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the AstraDB credentials (`ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT`, `ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN`, `ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE`) and `SECRET_KEY`. List all required env vars.
    *   **Running the Application:**
        *   **As a Monolith (Combined Services):**
            *   Command: `poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
            *   API Docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs` and `http://localhost:8000/redoc`.
        *   **As Individual Microservices (Example):**
            *   Account Management: `poetry run uvicorn app.main_account:service_app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001` (API Docs at `http://localhost:8001/docs`)
            *   Video Catalog: `poetry run uvicorn app.main_video_catalog:service_app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002` (API Docs at `http://localhost:8002/docs`)
            *   (List a few other services and their suggested ports as examples).
    *   **Linting and Type Checking:**
        *   Ruff (Lint & Format): `poetry run ruff check .` and `poetry run ruff format .`
        *   MyPy (Static Typing): `poetry run mypy .`
    *   **Running Tests:**
        *   `poetry run pytest`
        *   `poetry run pytest -v` (for verbose output)
        *   `poetry run pytest --cov=app tests/` (for coverage, if `pytest-cov` is added as a dev dep).
    *   **Project Structure:** Briefly explain the layout (`app/api`, `app/services`, `app/models`, `app/main_*.py` for services, `services_dockerfiles/`).
    *   **Building and Running with Docker (Example):**
        *   `docker build -t killrvideo/account-service -f services_dockerfiles/account_management.Dockerfile .`
        *   `docker run -p 8001:8000 --env-file .env killrvideo/account-service` (Explain that the `.env` file needs to be correctly sourced by Docker, or variables passed individually).
        *   (Mention the Video Catalog service build/run similarly).
    *   **(Optional) API Specification:** Link to where the API specification document (OpenAPI schema or Markdown) can be found if it's part of the repo or hosted elsewhere.

Current Files to Work On:
*   `app/main.py`
*   `README.md`

Provide the complete content for both `app/main.py` and `README.md`.
For `README.md`, use appropriate Markdown formatting.
For `pytest --cov`, you would need to add `pytest-cov` to dev dependencies: `poetry add --group dev pytest-cov`. Let's assume this is done for the README.
```

This set of prompts should complete Phase 2, leaving a well-structured, documented, and testable codebase ready for further AI/ML integration into the stubbed services or deployment.
